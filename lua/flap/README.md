# FLAP
An attempt at creating an flappy bird clone in less than two hours.

This is the original version and is notoriously bad lol

The [Flap_reloaded](/lua/flap_reloaded) version fixes most bugs and actually plays like a flappy bird clone (still has bad graphics.)

Created in lua using the [Love2D](love2d.org) game framework.
